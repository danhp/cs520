• Good job, but try and make sure everyone participates in the creation
  of the code generator; there's going to be a question about that on
  the final and you want all team members to know what's up.
• What does your code generator do for type aliases? Use the base type
  or create a new type in C++?
• Tip: what if a GoLite program uses a C++ keyword as a variable name,
  e.g. var typedef int = 3
